        # IESO Worldview GeoUI Agent — Multi-turn Chat

        Multi-turn chat with `IESOWorldviewGeoUIAgent`. The agent speaks
        **GeoIntent** through the GeoUI Protocol; visualisations come back
        as Worldview permalink URLs. Each turn carries forward the agent's
        prior `run_context`, so the conversation has memory.

        ### One-time setup

        Launch Chromium with remote debugging **before** opening this
        notebook, and point `PLAYWRIGHT_CDP_ENDPOINT` at it:

        ```bash
        # In one terminal — leave running:
        /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome \\
            --remote-debugging-port=9222 \\
            --user-data-dir=/tmp/worldview-chromium

        # In the notebook's .env (or shell that launches marimo):
        export PLAYWRIGHT_CDP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9222
        ```

        Each agent turn attaches a fresh Playwright MCP to this
        already-running Chromium via CDP, so the map's URL / pan / zoom
        survives across turns even though the MCP itself doesn't.

        ### Using it

        - Type a query (e.g. *"Show Saharan dust over the Atlantic on 2023-06-15"*).
        - The agent may answer directly, ask a clarifying question, or
          render a URL via `geoui_render_intent` once it has enough info.
        - After rendering, the agent calls `browser_navigate` to open the
          URL in your Chromium window. Pan, zoom, or scrub directly in
          the map — on the next turn the agent reads the live URL back
          via `browser_evaluate` and refines from there.
