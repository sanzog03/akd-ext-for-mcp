# Launch a long-lived Chromium with remote-debugging enabled, then run
# the VLM-baseline Worldview chat notebook against it. The Playwright
# MCP attaches to this Chromium per turn via CDP, so the map's URL /
# pan / zoom / layer state survives across chat turns even though the
# MCP itself doesn't.
#
# This is the VLM-baseline twin of ``ieso_w_geoui/start.sh``. The
# Chromium plumbing is identical between the two — only the final
# ``exec ... marimo ... ieso_w_vlm/notebooks/chat.py`` line differs.
# If a Chromium is already up from the GeoUI launcher on the same
# ``CDP_PORT``, this script will reuse it rather than spawning a
# second one.
#
# Browser: Playwright's bundled Chromium (from
# ~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/...) is used by default. It gets
# auto-installed via `npx playwright install chromium` on first run
# (~150 MB, one-time). To use a different browser instead, set
# CHROME_BIN to its executable.
#
# Re-running the script reattaches to the same Chromium instead of
# spawning a second one. Kill the browser manually when you're done:
#
#     pkill -f "remote-debugging-port=9222"
#
# Overrides via env vars:
#   CHROME_BIN                  path to a Chrome/Chromium binary
#                               (skips Playwright auto-resolve)
#   PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH    Playwright cache root (default
#                               ~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright)
#   CDP_PORT                    remote-debugging port (default 9222)
#   WORLDVIEW_CHROMIUM_PROFILE  user-data-dir (default /tmp/worldview-chromium)
#   MARIMO_MODE                 "run" (default) or "edit"
#
# Platform support:
#   - Bash + POSIX userspace (curl, ls, npx, uv). Does NOT run natively
#     on Windows cmd/PowerShell.
#   - Tested on macOS (Apple Silicon).
#   - Linux: the launch / CDP / marimo plumbing is portable, but the
#     Playwright Chromium auto-resolver below currently globs the
#     macOS-specific cache layout
#     (chromium-*/chrome-mac/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium).
#     On Linux you'll need to either:
#       (a) extend `find_playwright_chromium` to also match
#           chromium-*/chrome-linux/chrome under ~/.cache/ms-playwright, or
#       (b) set CHROME_BIN explicitly to a Chromium / Chrome binary.
#   - Windows: not supported natively. Workaround via WSL:
#       1. Install WSL (PowerShell, admin):  wsl --install
#       2. From the WSL shell, clone the repo and run start.sh from
#          inside WSL - it executes as Linux, so the Linux notes
#          above apply (cache at ~/.cache/ms-playwright, binary at
#          chrome-linux/chrome; either extend the resolver or set
#          CHROME_BIN). `npx playwright install chromium` inside WSL
#          will fetch the Linux Chromium build.
#       3. Open http://localhost:<marimo-port> in your Windows browser
#          - WSL2 forwards localhost transparently.
